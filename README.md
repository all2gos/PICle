Procedure to Indicate Clusters

a bunch of scripts that can predict the energy of CuNi bimetallic clusters based on machine learning stuff

the main goal of this procedure is to select the most attractive configurations of metal to catalyze CO2 transformation into CO/HCOOH automatically

this is quick and no expert knowledge is required!

Description:

Python files:

p*_name_of_script - Python file with some functions, gathered data, or class that the main script use to run the main procedure

stav.py - simple script to automate running VASP calculations

main.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook where everything is running

Other files:

all.csv - an exported database that included all information about clusters (this will be SQL file the in future)
