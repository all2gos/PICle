# PICle

PICle (which stands for Procedure to Indicate CLuster Energy) is a code for predicting the energy of clusters composed of copper and nickel using machine learning methods including deep learning

File legend:

*creating_data_sets* directory contains all files associated with the creation of the all.csv file, including files that automate the determination of cluster energy (stav.py and p8_*)

*clusters_phd.csv* file contains a collection of bimetallic clusters, the energy of which was determined by a PhD student, in the "conventional way" (standard optimization of systems) . The results contained therein represent a benchmark of the calculations carried out

*ML_stuff.ipynb* file performs, as the name implies, all operations related to machine learning
